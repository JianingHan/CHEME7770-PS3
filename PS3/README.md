## PS3 Solution

a) A stoichiometric array was created using the E.C numbers of reactions given in the question. The reactions were obtained from KEGG.
   The array can be found in the Book1 file.

b) Number of atoms of different elements in the species involved were used to form an atom matrix. The checkbalances.jl file was used to verify that the stoichiometric array was balanced. 

c) The solve.jl file was used to find out the maximum production of urea. For proper functioning of the code, Datadictionary.jl, Flux.jl,Include,jl,Utility,jl must be included.
